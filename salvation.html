<p>If you're not, why not? The Bible says you can <strong>know</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>"These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God that ye may know that ye have eternal life"
<br>1 John 5:13</blockquote>

<p>What must you do to <strong>know</strong> that you have eternal life?</p>

<p><strong>Realize</strong> that you are a sinner in the sight of God.</p>

<blockquote>"There is none righteous...for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.
<br>Romans 3:10, 23</blockquote>

<p><strong>Realize</strong> that because of your sin, you deserve God's punishment on sinners by being condemned to suffer for all eternity in a lake of fire (hell).</p>

<blockquote>"For the wages of sin is death"
<br>Romans 6:23</blockquote>

<blockquote>"...shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."
<br>Revelation 21:8</blockquote>

<p><strong>Realize</strong> that God loved you so much that He sent His Son, Jesus, to die on Calvary's cross in your place.</p>

<blockquote>"Christ died for our sins..." 1 Corinthians 15:3</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins" Colossians 1:14</blockquote>

<p><strong>Realize</strong> that good living cannot earn you a way into heaven. Jesus Christ is your ONLY way in.</p>

<blockquote>"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works."
<br>Ephesians 2:8-9</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I (Jesus) am the Way, the Truth, and the Life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"
<br>John 14:6</blockquote>

<p><strong>Repent</strong>; instead of trusting in yourself to earn heaven, turn to Christ and trust only Him and His full payment for your sin on Calvary's cross.</p>

<blockquote>"Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."
<br>Luke 13:3</blockquote>

<p><strong>Receive</strong> the Lord Jesus Christ and His substitute payment for your sin and condemnation to hell by sincerely and simply asking Him to save you.</p>

<blockquote>"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
<br>Romans 10:13</blockquote>

<blockquote>"saying God be merciful to me a sinner"
<br>Luke 18:13</blockquote>

<p>If you genuinely see your lost condition, and want to be saved, then bow your head right now, and receive Jesus Christ as your own personal Saviour. In sincere prayer to God, tell the Lord...</p>

<p>"Dear Lord ... I know that I am a sinner. I believe that my sin will send me to hell. Jesus, I believe that You shed Your blood and died on the cross of Calvary to pay the full penalty for my sin. I see that I can enter heaven no other way but through you. I now ask you to forgive my sin, to become my Saviour, and to take me to heaven when I die. Thank you, Lord, for saving my soul!"</p>
